/**
 *

This is what the schema of the the (persistent) database should look like:
Organization- Name- CreatedAt- UpdatedAt
Locations (belongs to Organization):- Name- Address- Latitude- Longitude- CreatedAt- UpdatedAt
Events (belongs to Organization):- Name- Date / Time (can modify these columns to fit your needs better.
 - Doesnâ€™t have to be exactly one column)- Description- CreatedAt- UpdatedAt

Bonus: When a user submits a location with an address, the latitude & longitude is gathered via the Google Places API.
